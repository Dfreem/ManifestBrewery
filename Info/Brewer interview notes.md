# Use Case Design a Homepage

### Brewer wants
- <ins>login page</ins>
- larger-er <ins> logo</ins>, maybe a <ins>background image/logo</ins>
- <ins>theme colors</ins>, not changing.

- brewer notes

### Branding
- *Mari Suggestion:* 
	- matching header on all pages 
	- footer for dev team branding

- header
	- logo
	- changeable background picture
	- name of brewery

- footer 
	- small branding for dev team

### Home Page
- login page?
- different for different roles
- dashboard style for servers, pretty tables for brewer

### Navbar
- *brewer suggestions*: dropdown or side-nav but should hide
- *brewer suggestions*: younger users/ servers want a <ins> POS button push style </ins> interface / <ins>"Dashboard" </ins>

### Roles
- other roles cannot see menu options that they do not have access to.

#### My Questions
- only your colors or small bits of other colors as-well?

#### my thoughts
need a full unit converter for weights, volumes and any other units that are not common between unit standards

# Use Case Maintain Supplier

#### hops
- different hops purveyors depending on whats is in stock or if some brewereies have leftover
	- co-ops
	- usually prefers imports 25 kg bag from **Germany** .
	- also uses 50lb bags of **American hops** 
	- ordered via phone call
	- sign into an account?
		- orders multiples of 11?
	- deals with different hop farms 

#### grains
- 1 main grains guy sends a catalog
	- a phone call to order

#### Yeast
- a few different labs for a few different types of yeast

==video notes==
2:40 - talking about hops
3:00 - switches to grains, explicitly
3:40 - "for those American hops, there those are 50 lbs a bag." likes quality out of Germany.
4:21 - still taking about hops, says "sometimes I have to go to different grain suppliers for those"
4:30 - "with hops, it's a little different" proceeds to explain how he orders hops.

#### other notes
- servers / pub employees use an i-pad.

### what is important to know about a supplier?
information for accountant
- name 
- physical address ==Watch address format for foreign companies==
- website
- contact phone
- contact email

better to run out than to waste a lot. *P & L*
